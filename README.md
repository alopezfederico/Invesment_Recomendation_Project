## Project Description
A client has hired the services of ARCOL Data Solutions and has requested that a complete analysis be carried out on the tourism business market in the United States and to create an App that presents a recommendation model with the purpose that interested potential investors have valuable information that allows them to make decisions about investing or not, according to their needs.
To do this, it provides data from the Yelp and Google Maps platforms, through a folder in the Google Drive cloud that it shares with the company.

## Preliminay Work

As preliminary work, business data that exists on Google Maps and Yelp is loaded.
In order to optimize the size of the files and the use of resources when working with the data, a change to parquet format is made, optimizing the use of resources by 69%.
Additionally, a preliminary analysis of the quality of the data contained in the files is carried out.
